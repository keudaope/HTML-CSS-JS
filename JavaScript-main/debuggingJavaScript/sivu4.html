          <p class="s10">Inspecting the Current Scope and Closure</p>
          <p>When the debugger is paused (e.g. at a breakpoint), you can inspect the
            values of variables in the scope as well as the closure by using the Scope
            Variables side panel in the Sources panel in DevTools. This can be useful
            debugging code that involves JavaScript closures.</p>

            <img src="images/Scope.png" alt="Scope variables">
            <figcaption>Fig9. Scope variables</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>The Scripts tab in Firebug also shows the values of all variables in the
            scope or closure.</p>
          <p class="s10">Browser Differences</p>
          <p>Several functionalities are provided via different APIs by different
            browsers. For example, to initiate an AJAX request, one needs to
            instantiate different objects in different browsers – XMLHttpRequest or
            ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP"). Also, different versions of Internet
            Explorer require instantiating different ActiveXObjects.</p>
          <p>Similarly, different browsers interpret JavaScript somewhat differently. For
            example, a trailing comma in a JavaScript array or object is ignored by
            all browsers except Internet Explorer. In IE, a trailing comma can lead to
            unexpected or undefined behavior.</p>
          <div class="koodi">
            <code>
              var arr = [ “a”, “b”, “c”, ]; // ok for non-IE browsers
            </code>
          </div>
          <p>If your code works fine in one browser, it is not necessarily possible that
            it may break in another. It is always a good idea to test your web page or
            application in as many browsers as possible.</p>
          <p>You can also use a library such as jQuery, which provides a cross-browser
            API that hides or works around individual browser issues (e.g. using jQuery.
            ajax for AJAX requests).
          <p class="s10">Loading Insecure Scripts</p>
          <p>If a web page served over HTTPS loads a script over HTTP, most
            browsers do not execute the child script. This can cause your web page
            or application to not function correctly. On some browsers, the user can
            control whether insecure scripts should be loaded on secure web pages.</p>
          <p>If your web page is served over HTTPS, you should ensure that all scripts
            that it loads (via its HTML or via JavaScript) should also be served over
            HTTPS.</p>
          <p class="s10">Interference from Browser Extensions</p>
          <p>If you have extensions (or add-ons) installed in your browser, they may
            interfere with your web page. While debugging, it might be useful to disable
            them to focus on debugging any issues in your JavaScript code.</p>
          <p>A quick way of achieving this with Google Chrome is to use the browser’s
            Incognito mode, which does not load any extensions by default.</p>
          <p>Note that browser extensions may still interfere with your web page on the
            user’s device, and you may want to handle that case.</p>

          <p class="s6">DEBUGGING JQUERY</p>
          <p>jQuery is perhaps the most popular JavaScript library that is used by web
            developers. Let’s look at some tools that can help in debugging when you
            use jQuery.</p>
          <p class="s10">Visual Event (Bookmarklet)</p>
          <p>Visual Event [4] is a JavaScript bookmarklet that visually shows information
            about events that have been attached to DOM elements. It highlights the
            elements that have event listeners attached to them, the types of events, as
            well as the code for the event handlers.</p>
          <p>In addition to several other libraries (e.g. YUI, MooTools, DOM 0 events)
            Visual Event also supports inspecting jQuery events. In the absence of
            such a tool, inspecting event listeners leads to code that lies in the jQuery
            library’s source. With Visual Event, one can directly inspect the user code
            that handles jQuery events.</p>
          <p class="s10">Browser Extensions</p>
          <p>jQuery Debugger [5] is a browser extension for Google Chrome. It allows
            you to:</p>
