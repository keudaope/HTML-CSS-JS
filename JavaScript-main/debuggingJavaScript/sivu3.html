          <p>In both these cases, if you want “this” to refer to the original object (when
            calling class methods), you should explicitly bind the original object to the
            callback, using “bind” (Function.prototype.bind). For instance, in the example
            above:</p>
          <div class="koodi">
            <code>
              var value = obj.value.bind(obj);<br />
              console.log(value()); // 10
            </code>
          </div>
          <p class="s10">Unintentional Global Variables</p>
          <p>In your JavaScript code, if you miss declaring a variable with the “var”
            keyword, the variable is defined as a global (i.e. on the “window” object).
            This can lead to bugs that can be hard to track down, since it is not a syntax
            error.</p>
          <div class="koodi">
            <code>
              var val = 10; <br />
              function process() {<br />
                //...<br />
                val = 12; // This modifies the global variable “val”<br />
              }<br />
              process();<br />
              console.log(val); // 12
            </code>
          </div>
          <p>Similarly, if you misspell a variable's name in a function (e.g. incorrect case),
            it will create or overwrite a global variable of that name.</p>
          <p class="s10">Network Data</p>
          <p>You can inspect both the outgoing and incoming network data from your
            web page or application using Chrome DevTools, Firebug, and other tools.
            This can be very useful when you receive unexpected data on the network.</p>
          <p>The Networks panel in DevTools shows you, for each network request, the
            “method” (e.g. GET, POST), the HTTP status code (e.g. 200, 403), the MIME-
            type (e.g. application/json), the content’s size and whether the network
            request was fulfilled from the browser’s cache. This information can come
            in useful when you do not see the effect of code recently modified on the
            server or on the client (because the browser was using the data from its
            cache).</p>
          <p>Developer tools in other browsers (e.g. Firebug) provide similar functionality.
          <p class="s10">Using the Console API Effectively</p>
          <p>The console.* API provides very useful functionality – we have already
            looked at log, warn, error, debug and assert.</p>
          <p>In addition to these is “console.trace()” which prints out the call stack at the
            point where it is called. This can be very useful in debugging complex code
            that involves a number of conditions to decide the code execution flow.</p>
          <p>In Chrome DevTools and Firebug, console.log() also accepts some printf-
            style format specifiers (such as “%s” and “%d”).</p>
          <p>console.dir() can be used to display all the properties of a JavaScript object.</p>
          <p>console.time(“name”) and console.timeEnd(“name”) can be used to
            measure (and label) the time between two points in the code execution.</p>
          <p>This helps you avoid creating Date objects to manually measure time
            intervals. Multiple console.time() and console.timeEnd() timers can also be
            used simultaneously.</p>
          <p>It is also a good idea to keep the JavaScript Console panel opened when
            working on a web page or application. The Console shows any runtime
            errors that the browser wants to bring to your notice.</p>
          <p class="s6">DEBUGGING DIFFICULT PROBLEMS</p>
          <p>Let’s now look at ways to debug problems that are hard to pin down.</p>
          <p class="s10">Logging All Calls to a Function</p>
          <p>Firebug has a unique functionality that allows you to log all invocations
            of a function. In addition, it also dumps the value of all arguments of the
            function with each invocation. This can be very helpful when one is deep
            within a workflow and in debugging third party code where one might not
            want to modify the existing code.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="sec2">
            <p>To log all calls to a function, one needs to console.log(functionName) in
              Firebug, and then right-click on the printed result and select “Log Calls to
              ‘functionName’.”</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/LogC.png" alt="Log Calls">
              <figcaption>Fig 6. Log calls to a function</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="s10">Finding Code that Initiated a Network Request</p>
            <p>If you see a failed (or any) network request and you want to see the
              code that initiated it, Chrome DevTools provides this functionality. In the
              Networks panel, the "Initiator" column shows the line of code or HTML
              that was responsible for a network request. For AJAX requests initiated via
              JavaScript, it also shows the call stack that triggered the network request,
              which can be seen by hovering the mouse pointer over the initiator column:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/HoverO.png" alt="Hover over the initiator column">
              <figcaption>Fig 7. Hover over the initiator column</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>You can also have DevTools pause JavaScript execution for all AJAX
              requests by setting an "XHR Breakpoint" in the Sources Panel. You can also
              specify a string that should be present in the URL for the breakpoint to be hit:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/XhrBp.png" alt="Setting the XHR breakpoint">
              <figcaption>Fig 8. Setting the XHR breakpoint</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="s10">Passing Functions to setTimeout in a for Loop</p>
            <p>If you pass an anonymous function as the first argument to setTimeout, and
              the anonymous function makes use of the for loop’s index, each invocation
              of the callback uses the same value of the index, unlike what you might have
              intended.</p>
            <div class="koodi">
              <code>
                for(var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;setTimeout(function() {<br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(i);<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;}, 100*i);<br />
                }
              </code>
            </div>
            <p>The above code prints out “5” five times to the Console. This is because the
                for loop completes before the first setTimeout callback executes and by
                then, the value of “i” (which is referenced by each of the five callbacks) is 5.
                To avoid this problem, you need to ensure that each callback gets its own
                copy of “i”. This can be done by either creating an anonymous closure for
                each callback or by using a named function:</p>
              <div class="koodi">
                <code>
                  for(var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;(function(index) {<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;setTimeout(function() {<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(index);<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}, 100*index);<br />
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;})(i);<br />
                  }
                </code>
              </div>
